  <!-- most of the elements on these pages are defined in the js files as functions, then we tell these functions where to show up on the page by placing empty divs and naming those divs the name of the js functions. check the js files to edit these elements in more detail.-->

    <!-- header that has the logo image and top page navigation. don't forget to put this on every page -->

        <section class="sr-only focusable" :focus>Panel 1: This is the first panel of the page.
          <br>Traditionally, comics are read top to bottom, left to right.</br>
          <br>In the case of this comic, that's the rule we'll use.</br>
        </section><!-- paragraphs don't allow individual control -->

        <section class="sr-only focusable" :focus>Panel 2: For abnormal grids, or the way panels are arranged, the rule still applies.
          <br>A long vertical panel like this will be read next, since it's the leftmost panel, even if it technically takes up two rows.</br>
          <br>Normally, smaller panels won't have this much text.</br>
        </section> <!-- adding a br is a new focus for screen readers, helps separate flow of audio -->

        <section class="sr-only focusable" :focus>Panel 3: The next panel is to the right of the vertical panel, finishing the rest of this row.
          <br>All of these panels have the same gutters, which is the empty space between panels.</br>
        </section>

        <section class="sr-only focusable" :focus>Panel 4: This page could be described as a 3 by 4 grid.
        </section>

        <section class="sr-only focusable" :focus>Panel 5: That's 3 panels across, and 4 panels tall.</br>
