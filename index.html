                  <br>Panel 3: The character on the other end of the radio is shown wearing a headset and a sweater, shaking their fist in annoyance. "You gotta hurry it up, I wanna get home in time for dinner!"

                  <br>Panel 3: Sir talks through the radio while Via puts on a safety vest, saying "You're gonna want to put your vest on, so hopefully they leave you alone. You are offering a critical service, after all...". 
                  <br>Panel 4: Something flies past the side of Via's head, disappearing into space.

                  <br>Panel 2: Via uses her hands to look out, squinting at whatever is out of view. Sir comes over the radio with, "Get out of there Via!" while Via continues talking, saying "I'm trying to read their sign. The Antique... Antiqua—".
                  <br>Panel 3: Sir comes over the radio again, saying "Oh, geez— Via, you need to go, NOW! I'll explain later!". But Via is waving her arms at the crowd of demonstrators, now shown in the distance. She yells to them, "HEYYY! I NEED TO PASS THROUGH!".
                  <br>Panel 4: Via has a blank face, hand half up in confusion. She thinks to herself, "Maybe I need to shout louder?".
                  <br>Panel 5: An explosion goes off behind Via, with a large BOOM and a cloud of smoke. Via clutches her head, saying "O—KAY, YUP! GETTING OUT!" to herself in panic.

                  <br>Panel 1: Via leans down to mess with the control panel of her ship while talking to herself. She mumbles, "Totally not stressed... disengaging magnetic load..." while another projectile from the demonstrators flies over her.
                  <br>Panel 2: The rest of the deliveries in the net fall to the ground with a loud THUD.
                  <br>Panel 3: Via flips one of three switches on her ships control panel.
                  <br>Panel 4: Via pulls down the handle of her ship with a CLUNK.
                  <br>Panel 5: Via takes off into space again on top of her ship, flying into the air and away from the satellite.

                  <br>Panel 2: A partial view of the side of Via's helmet, connected with the previous panel. Via thinks to herself, "Hopefully we make it out. It's so damn hard to see moving faster than the speed of light.".
                  <br>Panel 3: Between the three panels, Sir yells, "VIA!!!" as she travels on her ship, becoming a blur from how fast she's traveling.
                  <br>Panel 4: Another front view of Via's face, closer to her eyes to show they are squeezed shut from exertion. She thinks to herself, "Almost...".

                    <br>Panel 1: Via falls forward, flat on her face against the body of her ship. The impact makes a loud "THWACK," and she lets out a "HURK" noise from the impact.
                    <br>Panel 2: Via looks over her shoulder at the satellite she just left, now small in the distance. She thinks to herself, "Doesn't look like they're following."
                    <br>Panel 3: Via holds the side of her helmet with one hand, eyes closed. She thinks to herself, "That was scary..." while Sir comes over her radio, yelling, "HEY!".
                    <br>Panel 4: Sir is in her office, shaking her fist angrily at her screen. She yells into her headset, "You nearly killed ME with that stunt!".

                    <br>Panel 2: A close up of the video on screen, with indiscriminate blobs of the crowd. Sir says, "Looks like the projectile they shot was some sort of arrow." to Via.
                    <br>Panel 3: Via sits on her ship, clutching the handle with a "phew" sound. She says back to Sir, "What a relief...".
                    <br>Panel 4: Sir holds out her hand in frustration, seemingly looking at Via in the other panel. She says to her, "Yeah, maybe for you!".
                    <br>Panel 5: Via rides in between two floating buildings in space, returning to her workplace.

                  <br>Panel 2: Via takes off her safety vest while she tunes out Sir's lecture in the background. A snippet of her speech says, "Don't get mad at me. It's not a typical occupational hazard so I wasn't exactly able to make you aware of it.".
                  <br>Panel 3: Via takes off her helmet with a "fwp" sound, not saying anything in response to Sir.

                  <br>Panel 2: Via turns around, hair messy from changing. Her expression is unamused, staring back at Sir without a word.
                  <br>Panel 3: Sir puts on an apologetic face, waving Via off as she stands to the side, still displeased. Sir says to her, "Okay, haha, go get yourself cleaned up and head home or something.".
                  <br>Panel 4: Captions: CHANGED. Courtesy of the mail union's restroom. Via opens the door to leave, carrying her duffle bag with her. She says, "Alright Sir, I'll see you tomorrow for the damages." with Sir's reply of, "Bye, Via.".

                  <br>Panel 2: Via's blank face is off to the side, with a caption to the right. It says, "She often has a vacant look in her eyes, that entices so many people to befriend her! (not)". Another caption points at her, saying "head empty.".
                  <br>Panel 3: Via walks through an unspecified door, a bell hanging and making a "jingle" as she does.

                  <br>Panel 2: The girl continues the conversation, while the TV plays in the background with more details on the news report of the demonstration. She tells Via, "Oh, sorry! I forgot to mention I know your boss.", with Via asking her in return, "You know Sir?".

                  <br>Panel 2: The girl was talking in the background while Via thinks, behind the other frustrated side of her face. She says, "...and at first I was going to say no to her, but I'm a little lonely myself too.".
                  <br>Panel 3: Via responds fully to her, intrigued by what she heard. She asks, "You're lonely? You seem pretty friendly even if I don't know your name.", and the girl replies, "Oh! Well, it's a long story. But I could always use more friends!".

                  <br>Panel 2: Asa is still smiling as she asks again, "Well, how do you normally make friends?". Via replies bluntly, "You don't have to ask me like that.".
                  <br>Panel 3: The two of them shake hands, with a formal "CLASP".
                  <br>Panel 4: Asa smiles at Via, her eyes closed with a small "heh" of satisfaction.
