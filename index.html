                  <br>Panel 3: The character on the other end of the radio is shown wearing a headset and a sweater, shaking their fist in annoyance. "You gotta hurry it up, I wanna get home in time for dinner!"

                  <br>Panel 3: Sir talks through the radio while Via puts on a safety vest, saying "You're gonna want to put your vest on, so hopefully they leave you alone. You are offering a critical service, after all...". 
                  <br>Panel 4: Something flies past the side of Via's head, disappearing into space.

                  <br>Panel 2: Via uses her hands to look out, squinting at whatever is out of view. Sir comes over the radio with, "Get out of there Via!" while Via continues talking, saying "I'm trying to read their sign. The Antique... Antiqua—".
                  <br>Panel 3: Sir comes over the radio again, saying "Oh, geez— Via, you need to go, NOW! I'll explain later!". But Via is waving her arms at the crowd of demonstrators, now shown in the distance. She yells to them, "HEYYY! I NEED TO PASS THROUGH!".
                  <br>Panel 4: Via has a blank face, hand half up in confusion. She thinks to herself, "Maybe I need to shout louder?".
                  <br>Panel 5: An explosion goes off behind Via, with a large BOOM and a cloud of smoke. Via clutches her head, saying "O—KAY, YUP! GETTING OUT!" to herself in panic.

                  <br>Panel 3: Sir talks through the radio while Via puts on a safety vest, saying "You're gonna want to put your vest on, so hopefully they leave you alone. You are offering a critical service, after all...".

                  <br>Panel 2: Via uses her hands to look out, squinting at whatever is out of view. Sir comes over the radio with, "Get out of there Via!" while Via continues talking, saying "I'm trying to read their sign. The Antique... Antiqua—".
                  <br>Panel 3: Sir comes over the radio again, saying "Oh, geez— Via, you need to go, NOW! I'll explain later!". But Via is waving her arms at the crowd of demonstrators, now shown in the distance. She yells to them, "HEYYY! I NEED TO PASS THROUGH!".
                  <br>Panel 4: Via has a blank face, hand half up in confusion. She thinks to herself, "Maybe I need to shout louder?".
